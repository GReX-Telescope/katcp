//! Messages for implementing multi-client support
//!
//! KATCP-compliant devices may either support multiple simultaneous clients or only a single client. The multi-client
//! option is the preferred option for devices capable of implementing it as it provides a means of monitoring
//! a device while it is being controlled on a separate connection.
//!
//! Multi-client devices need not make any arrangements to share control â€“ they may simply accept commands
//! from all clients. Clients should arrange to handle shared control among themselves. It is expected that usually
//! a single client will have primary control and that other clients will only monitor the device, although this
//! arrangement is not required by KATCP.
//! To assist clients in tracking what other clients are connected a [`ClientList`] request is provided so the current
//! list of connected clients can be retrieved. A [`ClientConnected`] inform is sent to each connected client when
//! a new client is accepted.
//!
//! Replies to requests should be sent only to the client that made the request. Inform messages generated as part
//! of a reply should also only be sent to the client that made the request.
//!
//! Whether asynchronous informs are sent to multiple clients is determined by the type of inform. Of the core messages implemented
//! in this crate, only [`crate::messages::log::Log`] and [`ClientConnected`] are sent to multiple clients. All others are sent
//! to the single client associated with the event that triggered the inform. For `build_state`, `version` and
//! [`crate::messages::core::Disconnect`], it is the client connecting or being disconnected. For [`crate::messages::sensors::SensorStatus`] it is the client that configured the
//! sensor sampling strategy. The [`crate::messages::log::Log`] informs should be sent to all clients. The [`ClientConnected`]
//! informs should be sent to all clients except the one that has just connected.
//!
//! Devices should maintain one sensor sampling strategy per sensor per client and send sampled values only to
//! the client that set up the sampling strategy.
